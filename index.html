   <h1>Narcotics Anonymous</h1>
   <h3>A 12 Step Recovery Program</h3>
   <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSzIYZbQai0F6PdA6edYCXXmPq8kl_k4ixbbA&usqp=CAU" alt="">
   


   <p>NA is a nonprofit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a
    major problem. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other to stay clean.
    There are no dues or fees. The only requirement for membership is the desire to stop using.
     </p>
     <p>You don’t have to be clean when you get here, but after your first meeting we suggest that
        you keep coming back and come clean. You don’t have to wait for an overdose or jail sentence
        to get help from NA, nor is addiction a hopeless condition from which there is no recovery. It is
        possible to overcome the desire to use drugs with the help of the Twelve Step program of
        Narcotics Anonymous and the fellowship of recovering addicts.</p>

    <ol><h3>The 12 Steps</h3>
        <li>We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction, that
            our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
        <li>We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves
            could restore us to sanity.</li>
        <li>We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
            care of God as we understood Him.</li>
        <li>We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of
            ourselves.</li>
        <li>We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human
            being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
        <li>We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects
            of character.</li>
        <li>We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
        <li>We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became
            willing to make amends to them all.</li>
        <li>We made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
            except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
        <li>We continued to take personal inventory and when we were
            wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
        <li>We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
            conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying
            only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry
            that out.</li>
        <li> Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps,
            we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice
            these principles in all our affairs.</li>
    </ol>
